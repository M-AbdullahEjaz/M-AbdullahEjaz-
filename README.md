## About Me

I am a backend developer and AI engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, production-ready systems. My core expertise lies in designing APIs, integrating machine learning pipelines, and developing intelligent backend services that reduce cognitive load and improve decision-making.

I have hands-on experience with FastAPI, cloud infrastructure, vector search, and applied machine learning. As a co-founder of Found11 and Medin.AI, I actively work on real-world products at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence.
